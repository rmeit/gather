East Bay Pie Co was born from the minds of two long time Bay Area culinary industry colleagues. Rahul, one of the cofounders, was inspired by the Bay Area food scene, while Bill, the other cofounder, having grown up eating fresh produce right out of his grandma's garden, realized the importance of using local purveyors. Using their knowledge in the culinary world, they wanted to introduce a concept that provided customers with an array of flavors from all around the world. Made right out of their Emeryville kitchen, they utilize local vendors and top quality ingredients for their savory and sweet hand pies. They hope to let their customers experience the essence of different cultures through their simple, yet untraditional hand pies.",

For dessert, try our Bananas Foster Bread Pudding or our signature warm Beignets with chicory coffee. Whatever you try, you'll leave happy. Established in 2006.  Angeline's began as the dream of founder Robert Volberg as a way to bring southern hospitality and the delicious flavors of New Orleans to the bay area.  Inspired by the neighborhood jambalaya joints he had visited on a trip to the Big Easy six months before Katrina, Robert was looking for a location for his new restaurant when he struck up a conversation with a man in chef's pants in Oakland's Rockridge district.  The man was Chef Brandon Dubea from Baton Rouge, LA.  After working to develop an outstanding menu and create a delightful atmosphere, Angeline's opened quietly and gained popularity slowly after opening.  After reviews in the East Bay Express, SF Chronicle, Diablo Magazine and many others which hailed Chef Dubea's cuisine as 'authentic' and dishes as having 'real character', Angeline's was featured on an episode of 'Check Please, Bay Area'.  As word spread about the restaurant, Tempe Minaga completed the team as co-owner in mid 2008 to improve service and operations.",

When you enter Via del Corso, you may feel as if you are in any trattoria in Florence, Rome, or any other place in Italy. In the heart of North Berkeley, we bring you a place to relax, restore, dine and have drinks with family and friends. Leave the outside world outside for a moment. It is our pleasure to welcome you to Via del Corso. Established in 2008.  What would a Florentine Trattoria be like if dropped in the middle of Berkeley?  Chef/Owner Wendy Brucker spent her summers in Florence, her father a preeminent Florentine scholar.   Florentine cuisine flavors her love of food.    Chef Louis Legassic holds a mirror to the bold simplicity of the first little big city.  Local produce and meats transformed by Old World, time honored recipes and techniques: a neighborhood trattoria between Downtown Berkeley and the Gourmet Ghetto.  Dinner nightly.",

Established in 1983.  Founders Zach Zachowski &amp; Barbara Gabel grew up in small towns in Wisconsin. After living in Chicago for several years, they developed a taste for Chicago-style pizza. In 1983, they found themselves in the East Bay with dreams of opening their own pizza restaurant - with a California twist. Zach &amp; Barbara opened the original Zachary's on July 25, 1983 in the Rockridge neighborhood in Oakland. Business took off immediately. To meet the growing demand, they opened a second store in nearby Berkeley on Solano Avenue just over a year later in 1984. Two decades later, Zach &amp; Barbara began handing over the company to the employees. In 2006 Zachary's in San Ramon opened. Four years later in 2010 we became 100% employee-owned! In 2013 we opened Zachary's in Downtown Pleasant Hill. We celebrated 36 years in the Bay Area in 2019 by opening our second Oakland location in the Grand Lake neighborhood. Our most recent adventure was the relocation of Zachary's San Ramon to Pleasanton in July of 2021!",

A space that draws from the old Ashkenazi European Jewish tradition, the Mizrahi Israeli tradition, and the new world of New York, Los Angeles, and Berkeley. For us, that meant starting with locally sourced, humane, and sustainable ingredients, house-made pastrami and corned beef, hand-rolled and chewy bagels boil/baked daily. So gather around a table in our large dining room, reminisce over old favorites and discover new ones. Established in 1986.  In the 1930's the Saul's building was a produce depot right off the railroad tracks. Since the 1950's, it has housed a delicatessen: First the Pantry Shelf, then Rosenthal's, and finally Saul's, established in 1986, in honor of Saul Lichtenstein. Saul and his wife Ginny liked to feed people. Saul held forth and Ginny cooked. Friends and family would gather with him to eat, talk with their mouths full, trade stories. We like all that. So come. Eat. Locally owned and operated.  Find answers to these FAQ's on our website!  - Are your meats hormone and antibiotic free? Are the animals treated humanely? - Why is this night different from all others? - Why does the pastrami and corned beef seem more expensive than at other deli counters? - What size should a deli sandwich be? - Are the meats Kosher? - Is Saul's Kosher? - Why isn't there a good New York deli here?",

We're serving up classics like Meat Lovers and Original Stuffed Crust as well as signature wings, pastas and desserts at many of our locations. Order online or on the mobile app for carryout, curbside or delivery. Established in 1958.  In 1958, two brothers borrowed $600 from their mom to open a pizza place in Wichita, Kansas. They named it Pizza Hut because their sign only had room for eight letters. How profound! Soon, the restaurant grew. Why? The pizza was awesome. The service felt like home. And the customers were treated like family. And we've been delivering that same food and service ever since. For the Love of Pizza Since 1958. From day one, the Carney brothers could look their customers in the eye and promise them the finest pizza in town -- because they knew the farmers who grew the ingredients, and they knew those farmers cared about quality. Since then, our farmers have grown right alongside us, and the ingredients we use are still our highest priority. No one loves pizza more than Pizza Hut. That's why pizza is in our name -- and always will be.",

Established in 1983.  Founders Zach Zachowski &amp; Barbara Gabel grew up in small towns in Wisconsin. After living in Chicago for several years, they developed a taste for Chicago-style pizza. In 1983, they found themselves in the East Bay with dreams of opening their own pizza restaurant - with a California twist. Zach &amp; Barbara opened the original Zachary's on July 25, 1983 in the Rockridge neighborhood in Oakland. Business took off immediately. To meet the growing demand, they opened a second store in nearby Berkeley on Solano Avenue just over a year later in 1984. Two decades later, Zach &amp; Barbara began handing over the company to the employees. In 2006 Zachary's in San Ramon opened. Four years later in 2010 we became 100% employee-owned! In 2013 we opened Zachary's in Downtown Pleasant Hill. We celebrated 36 years in the Bay Area in 2019 by opening our second Oakland location in the Grand Lake neighborhood. Our most recent adventure was the relocation of Zachary's San Ramon to Pleasanton in July of 2021!",

Established in 2004.  Gioia Pizzeria was founded in May of 2004 by Will and Karen Gioia. Located on Hopkins Street in North Berkeley, Gioia is nestled in a food-lover's paradise frequented by neighborhood residents partaking of the delights of the street. For Karen and Will being part of the community is essential. They feel that a connection with a community is ideal for their business, which they envision as a family run joint selling the thin crust, east-coast style pizza of Will's childhood, with a focus on the organic, sustainably raised local ingredients so ready available in California.  A defining childhood moment of Will's is going down the street for a slice and a Coke. Will wanted to bring that tradition to the kids of his Berkeley neighborhood, as well as working families and anyone who can appreciate grabbing a slice or a pie on the run, or sitting on one of the stools in the store watching the pizza makers spin dough and their neighbors coming and going.",

Established in 1990.  Built by a local fireman in 1926 and immediately rented by a bootlegger named Blackie, Townhouse went from Speakeasy to brothel, to bar, to family restaurant known as Vernetti's Towhouse and back to bar again until its current incarnation, Townhouse Bar &amp; Grill. Opened by Ellen Hope and French restaurateur Joseph LeBrun in 1990, Townhouse served up simple dishes in a rustic yet elegant space. Townhouse Bar &amp; Grill had been Chef Ellen's pride and joy since 2002 when she became the soul owner and operator.   With 2020 came a global pandemic and the end of an era - Townhouse had to close its doors and Ellen has passed the torch onto a trusted and experienced team. Keeping in the tradition of comfort classics with an elevated  style, our new kitchen crew has created a menu that's fresh, local and serves as an ode to our cherished and storied history. Come and enjoy what the new team has cultivated at the old Townhouse.",

Some favorites include the IPAX West Coast style IPA, Red Rock American Red Ale, Black Rock Porter, Stonehenge Stout, Titanium American Strong Ale, Pinnacle English Style Pale Ale, and Dragon's Milk American Brown Ale, but make sure to check out the rotating selection of small batch specialty brews. Established in 1985.  Brothers John and Reid Martin (then ages 25 and 28), established Triple Rock in 1985. Triple Rock is the result of John and Reid's love for beer and brewing, as well as the love of classic American taverns (and dive bars). For Triple Rock, their idea was to create a place that would be simple and accessible to craft beer and classic tavern aficionados like themselves.  More than 25 years after brewing their first brew, John and Reid Martin are considered &quot;founding fathers&quot; in the brewpub industry, and have gone on to build a small empire of award-winning breweries and bars (Big Time Brewery in Seattle, Drakes Brewing Co. in San Leandro, and Jupiter in Berkeley). Still, Triple Rock remains their favorite. &quot;It's where real brewpub beer began in the Bay Area,&quot; says John. &quot;We feel lucky to have been there at the beginning of the craft brewing renaissance&quot;.

Alberto moved from the city of Treviso and brought with him the Italian Gelato tradition of his great uncle Dino, a true gelato legend.  Dino taught Alberto how to carefully prepare traditional delicious gelato. He also explained how cutting corners is just not an option when preparing fresh food.   Flavors such as the famous Toasted Almond and Caramelized Figs and the Lavender and Fresh Blueberries quickly became Almare's signature.  In 2012 Simone Arpaio moved from his hometown of Turin and partnered up with Alberto. With more ideas and a renewed energy Almare entered into the wholesale business and since then have been proudly providing high quality gelato to some of the best restaurants of the Bay Area.   In 2016 we opened our second location in Downtown Pleasanton where we can craft our gelato every morning like we do in Berkeley. Come visit us for a taste of real traditional Italian gelato!  Ciao",

Step two was collecting organic ingredients to use in our favorite dishes that could create a menu Californians would be excited about. We then cooked these things together with our familial warmth until they were perfectly done and opened our doors in Berkeley. So, when people ask us what our favorite recipe is, we tell them it's the one that got us here. Whether you're a local foodie or a student at the university, everyone has a home at JotMahal. Established in 2016.  Mr. Gurnam Singh, the proud new owner of JotMahal, has been a chef for the past 25 years. Over the course of his career, Singh has prided himself on preparing fresh halal dishes for his numerous and recurring customers. His dream of owning his own place has finally come true with the opening of our restaurant in Berkeley.",

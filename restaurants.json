East Bay Pie Co was born from the minds of two long time Bay Area culinary industry colleagues. Rahul, one of the cofounders, was inspired by the Bay Area food scene, while Bill, the other cofounder, having grown up eating fresh produce right out of his grandma's garden, realized the importance of using local purveyors. Using their knowledge in the culinary world, they wanted to introduce a concept that provided customers with an array of flavors from all around the world. Made right out of their Emeryville kitchen, they utilize local vendors and top quality ingredients for their savory and sweet hand pies. They hope to let their customers experience the essence of different cultures through their simple, yet untraditional hand pies."

For dessert, try our Bananas Foster Bread Pudding or our signature warm Beignets with chicory coffee. Whatever you try, you'll leave happy. Established in 2006.  Angeline's began as the dream of founder Robert Volberg as a way to bring southern hospitality and the delicious flavors of New Orleans to the bay area.  Inspired by the neighborhood jambalaya joints he had visited on a trip to the Big Easy six months before Katrina, Robert was looking for a location for his new restaurant when he struck up a conversation with a man in chef's pants in Oakland's Rockridge district.  The man was Chef Brandon Dubea from Baton Rouge, LA.  After working to develop an outstanding menu and create a delightful atmosphere, Angeline's opened quietly and gained popularity slowly after opening.  After reviews in the East Bay Express, SF Chronicle, Diablo Magazine and many others which hailed Chef Dubea's cuisine as 'authentic' and dishes as having 'real character', Angeline's was featured on an episode of 'Check Please, Bay Area'.  As word spread about the restaurant, Tempe Minaga completed the team as co-owner in mid 2008 to improve service and operations."

Established in 1983.  Founders Zach Zachowski & Barbara Gabel grew up in small towns in Wisconsin. After living in Chicago for several years, they developed a taste for Chicago-style pizza. In 1983, they found themselves in the East Bay with dreams of opening their own pizza restaurant - with a California twist. Zach & Barbara opened the original Zachary's on July 25, 1983 in the Rockridge neighborhood in Oakland. Business took off immediately. To meet the growing demand, they opened a second store in nearby Berkeley on Solano Avenue just over a year later in 1984. Two decades later, Zach & Barbara began handing over the company to the employees. In 2006 Zachary's in San Ramon opened. Four years later in 2010 we became 100% employee-owned! In 2013 we opened Zachary's in Downtown Pleasant Hill. We celebrated 36 years in the Bay Area in 2019 by opening our second Oakland location in the Grand Lake neighborhood. Our most recent adventure was the relocation of Zachary's San Ramon to Pleasanton in July of 2021!"

Order online or on the mobile app for carryout, curbside or delivery. Established in 1958.  In 1958, two brothers borrowed $600 from their mom to open a pizza place in Wichita, Kansas. They named it Pizza Hut because their sign only had room for eight letters. How profound! Soon, the restaurant grew. Why? The pizza was awesome. The service felt like home. And the customers were treated like family. And we've been delivering that same food and service ever since. For the Love of Pizza Since 1958. From day one, the Carney brothers could look their customers in the eye and promise them the finest pizza in town -- because they knew the farmers who grew the ingredients, and they knew those farmers cared about quality. Since then, our farmers have grown right alongside us, and the ingredients we use are still our highest priority. No one loves pizza more than Pizza Hut. That's why pizza is in our name -- and always will be."

Located on Hopkins Street in North Berkeley, Gioia is nestled in a food-lover's paradise frequented by neighborhood residents partaking of the delights of the street. For Karen and Will being part of the community is essential. They feel that a connection with a community is ideal for their business, which they envision as a family run joint selling the thin crust, east-coast style pizza of Will's childhood, with a focus on the organic, sustainably raised local ingredients so ready available in California.A defining childhood moment of Will's is going down the street for a slice and a Coke. Will wanted to bring that tradition to the kids of his Berkeley neighborhood, as well as working families and anyone who can appreciate grabbing a slice or a pie on the run, or sitting on one of the stools in the store watching the pizza makers spin dough and their neighbors coming and going."

Current owners Sam Tobis and Jose Mendoza rather than replicating the delis of New York, are creating a space that connects with roots all along the timeline of the Jewish diaspora. A space that draws from the old Ashkenazi European Jewish tradition, the Mizrahi Israeli tradition, and the new world of New York, Los Angeles, and Berkeley. For us, that meant starting with locally sourced, humane, and sustainable ingredients, house-made pastrami and corned beef, hand-rolled and chewy bagels boil/baked daily. So gather around a table in our large dining room, reminisce over old favorites and discover new ones. Established in 1986.  In the 1930's the Saul's building was a produce depot right off the railroad tracks. Since the 1950's, it has housed a delicatessen: First the Pantry Shelf, then Rosenthal's, and finally Saul's, established in 1986, in honor of Saul Lichtenstein. Saul and his wife Ginny liked to feed people. Saul held forth and Ginny cooked. Friends and family would gather with him to eat, talk with their mouths full, trade stories. We like all that. So come. Eat. Locally owned and operated.Find answers to these FAQ's on our website!- Are your meats hormone and antibiotic free? Are the animals treated humanely?- Why is this night different from all others?- Why does the pastrami and corned beef seem more expensive than at other deli counters?- What size should a deli sandwich be?- Are the meats Kosher?- Is Saul's Kosher?- Why isn't there a good New York deli here?"

We then cooked these things together with our familial warmth until they were perfectly done and opened our doors in Berkeley. So, when people ask us what our favorite recipe is, we tell them it's the one that got us here. Whether you're a local foodie or a student at the university, everyone has a home at JotMahal.

Since 2000, Little Plearn Thai Kitchen has continued her recipes and influences. Her favorite curries and taste have not changed. We still continue to make curry from scratch, soups are made to order, sauce are from Thai herbs and spices. This takes time but we wouldn't have it any other way.

Established in 1983.  Founders Zach Zachowski & Barbara Gabel grew up in small towns in Wisconsin. After living in Chicago for several years, they developed a taste for Chicago-style pizza. In 1983, they found themselves in the East Bay with dreams of opening their own pizza restaurant - with a California twist. Zach & Barbara opened the original Zachary's on July 25, 1983 in the Rockridge neighborhood in Oakland. Business took off immediately. To meet the growing demand, they opened a second store in nearby Berkeley on Solano Avenue just over a year later in 1984. Two decades later, Zach & Barbara began handing over the company to the employees. In 2006 Zachary's in San Ramon opened. Four years later in 2010 we became 100% employee-owned! In 2013 we opened Zachary's in Downtown Pleasant Hill. We celebrated 36 years in the Bay Area in 2019 by opening our second Oakland location in the Grand Lake neighborhood. Our most recent adventure was the relocation of Zachary's San Ramon to Pleasanton in July of 2021!"

Established in 1985.  Brothers John and Reid Martin (then ages 25 and 28), established Triple Rock in 1985. Triple Rock is the result of John and Reid's love for beer and brewing, as well as the love of classic American taverns (and dive bars). For Triple Rock, their idea was to create a place that would be simple and accessible to craft beer and classic tavern aficionados like themselves.More than 25 years after brewing their first brew, John and Reid Martin are considered &quot;founding fathers&quot; in the brewpub industry, and have gone on to build a small empire of award-winning breweries and bars (Big Time Brewery in Seattle, Drakes Brewing Co. in San Leandro, and Jupiter in Berkeley). Still, Triple Rock remains their favorite. &quot;It's where real brewpub beer began in the Bay Area,&quot; says John. &quot;We feel lucky to have been there at the beginning of the craft brewing renaissance&quot;. Some say that you can see a little of Triple Rock in almost every brewpub."

Established in 1990.  Built by a local fireman in 1926 and immediately rented by a bootlegger named Blackie, Townhouse went from Speakeasy to brothel, to bar, to family restaurant known as Vernetti's Towhouse and back to bar again until its current incarnation, Townhouse Bar & Grill. Opened by Ellen Hope and French restaurateur Joseph LeBrun in 1990, Townhouse served up simple dishes in a rustic yet elegant space. Townhouse Bar & Grill had been Chef Ellen's pride and joy since 2002 when she became the soul owner and operator. With 2020 came a global pandemic and the end of an era - Townhouse had to close its doors and Ellen has passed the torch onto a trusted and experienced team. Keeping in the tradition of comfort classics with an elevated  style, our new kitchen crew has created a menu that's fresh, local and serves as an ode to our cherished and storied history. Come and enjoy what the new team has cultivated at the old Townhouse."

Staying honest and cooking the best food is who we are. What a ride this has been. What great people we've met. Looking to see you at the Alley soon."

The elegant dining hall features Indian artwork inspired by the caves of Ajanta. Altogether, Ajanta is one of the best places to experience sophisticated Indian dining in the East Bay. Established in 1993.  Chef Lachu Moorjani immigrated to USA in to work as an engineer. He missed Indian food and checked out all the Indian restaurants in the Bay Area. His dining experience in these restaurants left him very dis-satisfied. Being a lover of good food, he decided to cook for himself in a serious way. Soon, his reputation as a cook spread and he was recruited by a couple of his friends to open an Indian restaurant in San Francisco in 1974. The partnership did not work. In 1987, he opened a small restaurant in Berkeley on his own called New Delhi Junction. At this restaurant Mr. Moorjani offered a menu with dishes from various regions of India. The small restaurant did very well. In 1993, Mr. Moorjani sold New Delhi Junction and opened Ajanta. He expanded the regional part of the menu, brought in organic ingredients, and introduced Chef's Tasting menu. As evidenced by numerous awards, Mr. Moorjani has succeeded  in his mission to provide in-comparable Indian dining experience to his patrons."

We are proud to be part of berkeley's established tradition of authentic, fine food. Established in 2008.  Almare Gelato was founded by Alberto Malvestio in 2008.Alberto moved from the city of Treviso and brought with him the Italian Gelato tradition of his great uncle Dino, a true gelato legend.Dino taught Alberto how to carefully prepare traditional delicious gelato. He also explained how cutting corners is just not an option when preparing fresh food. Flavors such as the famous Toasted Almond and Caramelized Figs and the Lavender and Fresh Blueberries quickly became Almare's signature.In 2012 Simone Arpaio moved from his hometown of Turin and partnered up with Alberto. With more ideas and a renewed energy Almare entered into the wholesale business and since then have been proudly providing high quality gelato to some of the best restaurants of the Bay Area. In 2016 we opened our second location in Downtown Pleasanton where we can craft our gelato every morning like we do in Berkeley.Come visit us for a taste of real traditional Italian gelato!Ciao"

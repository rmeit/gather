Angeline's began as the dream of founder Robert Volberg as a way to bring southern hospitality and the delicious flavors of New Orleans to the bay area.  Inspired by the neighborhood jambalaya joints he had visited on a trip to the Big Easy six months before Katrina, Robert was looking for a location for his new restaurant when he struck up a conversation with a man in chef's pants in Oakland's Rockridge district.  The man was Chef Brandon Dubea from Baton Rouge, LA.  After working to develop an outstanding menu and create a delightful atmosphere, Angeline's opened quietly and gained popularity slowly after opening.  After reviews in the East Bay Express, SF Chronicle, Diablo Magazine and many others which hailed Chef Dubea's cuisine as 'authentic' and dishes as having 'real character', Angeline's was featured on an episode of 'Check Please, Bay Area'.
